    "# Permutations Counting Without Replacement Order Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the notion of permutation relates to the act of permuting (rearranging) objects or values. Informally, a permutation of a set of objects is an arrangement of those objects into a particular order. For example, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). As another example, an anagram of a word is a permutation of its letters. The study of permutations in this sense generally belongs to the field of combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of permutations of n distinct objects is \"n factorial\" usually written as \"n!\", which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutations occur, in more or less prominent ways, in almost every area of mathematics. They often arise when different orderings on certain finite sets are considered, possibly only because one wants to ignore such orderings and needs to know how many configurations are thus identified. For similar reasons permutations arise in the study of sorting algorithms in computer science.\n",

    "    N is the number of things you are choosing from,\n",

    "5C3 or 5 choose 3 refers to how many combinations are possible from 5 items, taken 3 at a time. What is a combination? Just the number of ways you can choose items from a list. For example, if you had a box of five different kinds of fruit and you could choose 2, you might get an apple and an orange, an orange and a pear, or a pear and an orange. But how many combinations are possible?\n",
